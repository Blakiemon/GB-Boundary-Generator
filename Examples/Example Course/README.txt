PROCESSING A COURSE EXAMPLE:

This program can process .SSG4X course files. (GB courses only)

It will replace all terrain objects named "LeftBoundary" with real boundaries that point in their respective "LeftBoundary"s angle for 10,000 pixels. 


If you have the Golf Blitz editor, open up one the example course and notice the position and angle of each object named "LeftBoundary"


Then try processing one of the course's Hole 1 with Boundary Generator and re-open it to see what happened. It will look empty on sight, but when you enter play mode and turn on the collision debug view you will see the boundaries are indeed there.
